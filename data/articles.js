    "title": "Victorian coronavirus hotel quarantine nurse alleges DHHS relaxed infection controls to appease guests",
    "content": "Departmental staff in charge of running Melbourne's quarantine hotels were more concerned with appeasing guests than infection control, according to a nurse who worked at the troubled facilities.  Some guests were given extra so-called \"fresh air\" breaks and took advantage of the increasingly relaxed system, threatening to self-harm if they were not given allowances to leave their rooms, the nurse - who does not want to be named - said.  She said she believed the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was unnerved by a suspected suicide that occurred at the Pan Pacific hotel in South Wharf in April, during the first two weeks of hotel quarantine coming into force.  The suspected suicide is being investigated by the coroner.  The nurse said the whole focus became about ensuring guests were satisfied, rather than quarantined.  \"They were just trying to fix guests' anxiety, and as a result [staff] started having too many interactions with guests,\" she said.  \"We should have been seeing them as infrequently as possible.\"  In one instance, the nurse said she was asked by a team leader to babysit one of the guest's children for a couple of hours so the guest could clean their room and have a break - a request she refused.  Guests in some hotels also communicated through Facebook groups, she said, discussing how to beat the restrictions, which put hotel staff under more pressure.  \"Things like 'tell them you've got a psych issue and then they have to give you a fresh air break' were doing the rounds,\" she said.  \"We had people calling us saying 'I'm going to kill myself if I don't have a cigarette outside right now'. You've got no choice but to take that threat seriously.\"  The nurse said guests were only meant to have two fresh air breaks a week, escorted by a security guard or a nurse for roughly 15 minutes, but this became more frequent for guests if they complained.  Some people were allowed to leave their room every day for a half-hour cigarette break because they became threatening and aggressive otherwise, she said.  \"Human nature is that you will play up if you're given the scope to. And these people were allowed to,\" she said.  She said some guests and security guards did not wear their masks properly during the breaks, and in some instances guests were smoking and did not wear a mask at all.  At least one guest she escorted out for a cigarette break tested positive for COVID-19 a few days later.  \"I had just been standing there a few metres from them while they had their mask off. Members of the public were also walking past. It shouldn't have been happening,\" she said.  The ABC has seen payslips showing the nurse worked at more than half a dozen Melbourne quarantine hotels between April and July, including the Stamford Plaza, where one outbreak occurred.  She said each hotel was run differently, depending on the DHHS member in charge.  When asked if there had been any changes in policy or attitudes after the suicide in hotel quarantine, Mr Andrews said the concerns raised by the nurse \"probably speaks to at least that person's view ... a tone or atmosphere very much on the ground\", rather than policy decisions.  \"We did have a tragedy ... someone did take their own life in that program. That much is true,\" he said.  \"But beyond that, IÂ couldn't speak to some of theÂ comments and appraisals that areÂ made in that [ABC] report today, but thatÂ may well be of interest to Judge Coate.\"  Guards fist-bumped guests, shared lifts: nurse  The nurse also backed up previous whistleblower accounts about the standard of security guards at the hotel, saying she witnessed one fist-bumping a group of guests, multiple staff members travelling in lifts with guests and other security staff sitting down on their phones the entire day when they were meant to be actively guarding hotel floors.  However, she said some of the hotels she worked at had extremely good protocols in place, such as only the one staff member touching lift buttons or travelling in lifts with guests, and it was harder for guests to get special dispensations.  \"If more people had spoken out from the start, maybe this wouldn't have happened,\" she said.  Victoria's current coronavirus outbreak, which has led to tough stage 4 restrictions, could potentially be attributed to the botched hotel quarantine system.  An independent inquiry into the system was expected to begin public hearings this week, but the implementation of stage 4 restrictions resulted in those hearings being delayed until August 17.  The inquiry will focus on the administration of quarantine by Unified at Rydges in Carlton and MSS Security at the Stamford Plaza, but industry figures said more needed to be done to weed out the second and third tier of subcontractors, which were relied upon to service the contracts.  The state's hotel quarantine system has been put on hold for international travellers during the surge in recent infections.  Messages reveal concerns guards fell asleep on the job  Security guards and subcontractors who worked at quarantine hotels have told the ABC they remain concerned that the inquiry will not fully uncover the litany of errors which plagued the scheme.  Messages sent via WhatsApp by a security guard manager to his staff, and seen by the ABC, indicate the manager was informed as early as April 27 that guards were falling asleep on the job at one hotel.  Other WhatsApp messages from a manager at Silvans Facility Services, which was subcontracted by Unified to provide guards at several hotels, show him telling his staff they should be grateful for the work, rather than complaining about conditions or disregarding instructions.  In early May, the manager forwarded a series of screenshots of messages from prospective guards who he said had contacted him in the past five hours seeking shifts.  \"It breaks my heart to say no to them and makes me sad and some are ready to work for $15 an hour or 'wtever [sic] you can pay'. These guys are waiting to be exploited as they are so desperate,\" the manager wrote.  \"I just wanted you all to understand my work is not easy. If you are not serious still and disregarding instructions and don't want to be a team player, then some of these people will replace you.\"  Silvans part-owner and national operations manager Kapil Bhatia declined to comment, but said he would cooperate with the inquiry if called.  Another guard who worked for Silvans said he received \"perfect\" access to PPE and training, and personally saw five guards being asked to leave their shifts because of a failure to wear masks or proper uniform.  A separate subcontractor who provided guards to Unified at Rydges said he had also seen staff sent home for minor uniform breaches, such as wearing the wrong socks.  He questioned whether the system failures were because of the behaviour of individual guards, rather than the contractors.  The subcontractor said the framing of cash payments as something solely pushed by employers was incorrect, as many employees requested to be paid this way to ensure they remained eligible for other government payments or did not breach visa conditions.  He also said reports that hotel guards were recruited via WhatsApp or Gumtree gave the false impression this was a new practice, rather than a necessary measure in an underregulated industry where demand for work can fluctuate wildly.  Dozens of guards can be required to fill shifts at short notice, a fact underlined in a text message seen by the ABC which was sent by a manager at the Security Hub, which was a subcontractor for MSS Security, requesting a guard to fill a shift with less than 10 hours' notice at the Stamford Plaza.  The Security Hub declined to comment, but a spokesman confirmed they planned to cooperate with the inquiry, which has listed it as one of 14 private entities of interest.  The Premier has declined to give detailed answers to questions about hotel quarantine while the judicial inquiry is imminent.  A DHHS spokesman declined to answer detailed questions about the quarantine program or allegations raised by the nurse, saying it would be inappropriate to comment while the inquiry remained ongoing.",

    "title": "Large for Gestational Age and Risk for Academic Delays and Learning Disabilities: Assessing Modification by Maternal Obesity and Diabetes",
    "content": "ABSTRACT    The objective of this study was to examine academic delays for children born large for gestational age (LGA) and assess effect modification by maternal obesity and diabetes and then to characterize risks for LGA for those with a mediating condition. Cohort data were obtained from the New York City Longitudinal Study of Early Development, linking birth and educational records (n = 125,542). Logistic regression was used to compare children born LGA (>90th percentile) to those born appropriate weight (5–89th percentile) for risk of not meeting proficiency on assessments in the third grade and being referred to special education. Among children of women with gestational diabetes, children born LGA had an increased risk of underperforming in mathematics (ARR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.07–1.31)) and for being referred for special education (ARR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02–1.37)). Children born LGA but of women who did not have gestational diabetes had a slightly decreased risk of academic underperformance (mathematics-ARR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90–0.97); Language arts-ARR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94–0.99)). Children born to women with gestational diabetes with an inadequate number of prenatal care visits were at increased risk of being born LGA, compared to those receiving extensive care (ARR: 1.67 (95% CI: 1.20–2.33)). Children born LGA of women with diabetes were at increased risk of delays; greater utilization of prenatal care among these diabetic women may decrease the incidence of LGA births.  FULL TEXT    1. Introduction   Maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy increase risks for maternal and infant morbidity [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Among these risks, being born large for gestational age (>90th percentile weight for gestational age) is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes including shoulder dystocia and birth injury [6]. Children born large for gestational age (LGA) of obese or diabetic women also are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome in childhood [8]. The long-term delays associated with being born LGA of women with and without metabolic conditions have not been well-studied.  Paulson, Mehta, Sokol and Chauhan examined the association between LGA long-term cognitive differences and reported no difference when children were compared to those born appropriate weight for gestational age (5–89th percentile) [9]. Khambalia, Algert, Bowen, Collie and Roberts reported a higher percentage of children born LGA at term meeting national reading standards compared to those born appropriate weight at term [10]. However, these studies did not differentiate and report by maternal risk factors such as maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy. This may be important as these maternal conditions may differentially affect fetal cognitive development and later academic achievement.  As mechanisms for large fetal growth are diverse [11], we hypothesized that risks for delays associated with being born LGA may be modified by maternal conditions in which aberrant fetal growth may be accelerated by a disturbed metabolic milieu, specifically in pregnancies complicated by obesity and diabetes and this disturbed milieu may alter cognitive development. While early childhood environment, nutrition and socioeconomic and cultural factors play a role in shaping neurodevelopment and educational attainment, further exploration of specific mechanisms in the fetal environment impacting these outcomes is critical. Using a large, US-based cohort, the aim of this study was to assess risks for long-term delays for children born LGA as compared to children born appropriate weight for gestational age and to assess effect modification by maternal obesity and diabetes. When an association was identified, we sought to characterize the maternal and perinatal differences between the children born large versus appropriate weight for gestational age. We hypothesize that children born LGA of women with a metabolic condition would be at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. We also hypothesize that poor utilization of prenatal care may be associated with children being born LGA and therefore a potential area for intervention.  2. Materials and Methods  2.1. Population Cohort data were obtained from the NYC Longitudinal Study of Early Development data warehouse that contains records from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of all births in NYC from 1994–2004 linked with the NYC Department of Education’s records of children that attended NYC public schools. Data were obtained from the Longitudinal Study of Early Development data warehouse, a compilation of linked deidentified data from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the NYC Department of Education. This database comprises linked data from birth records and school reports, including achievement scores on the standards-based mathematics and English language arts assessments administered in the third grade and information on whether the child was referred for special education at any time. For our study, the inclusion criteria required the availability of birth record data and third-grade test score data. Children born of a singleton pregnancy to a mother 18–45 years of age were included in this study. To eliminate other causes of neurodevelopmental delays, children born with a genetic or congenital anomaly, to a mother with rubella or a sexually transmitted disease, or born less than 32 weeks gestational age were excluded. The study was limited to children born large or appropriate weight for gestational age; children born small for gestational age (<10th percentile weight for gestational age) were removed from the analytical cohort. This study was approved by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Institutional Review Board. All data were deidentified. 2.2. Measures   Gender-specific US-standard birth weights for gestational age reference values derived by Oken et al. were used to create the weight for gestational age variables using birth weight and gestational age, as used in other studies [9,12]. Children born at the 10–90th percentile weight for gestational age were coded as an appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA) and greater than the 90th percentile were coded as LGA.  Maternal obesity was reported as ≥200 lb prepregnancy as done in other studies when height data were not available to compute BMI [13,14]. As a reference, at ≥200 lb, women shorter than 5’9”, which represents 95% of the population, would have a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 which is obese [15,16]. Maternal diabetes was assessed as two separate conditions available in this dataset: pregestational and gestational diabetes. When both conditions were indicated, the condition was recoded as pregestational diabetes, only.  Outcomes assessed included children meeting proficiency on the third grade standards-based mathematics and English language arts assessments and being referred for special education at any time. Nationally in the US, statewide educational assessments are required as part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Public Law 107–110, with the goal for all students to reach proficiency on each subject-based assessment [17]. The development process for these subject-based standards assessments includes a rigorous process at the state-level including assessment of content and construct validity [18]. Student performance scores on these assessments are reported on a four-point scale. A score of 1 or 2 indicates the student did not meet proficiency; conversely, a score of 3 or 4 indicates the student met or exceeded proficiency. We assessed the bivariate outcome: met/did not meet proficiency on the mathematics assessment and met/did not meet proficiency on the English Language arts assessment.  Covariates included maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, country of origin, marital status, insurance payer, parity, tobacco, alcohol or drug use during pregnancy, excessive gestational weight gain, infant sex and year of birth. Covariates were chosen based on the theoretical relevance of each variable. Variable coding was identical to our previous study and noted in Table 1 (in Results section).  If the effect of being born LGA in relation to delays differed depending on whether the children’s mothers had a particular metabolic condition during pregnancy, perinatal outcomes for the group were characterized and the association between maternal prenatal care utilization and being born LGA within the group was assessed. Perinatal outcomes included dichotomous variables (yes/no) for maternal chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, preterm birth, need for neonatal intensive care unit, abnormal metabolic condition of newborn, anemia, seizure, intubation of newborn and birth injury.  The Kotelchuck Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU) Index was used to assess prenatal care utilization. The APNCU Index, detailed elsewhere [19], is a summary index consisting of two components: Adequacy of Initiation of Prenatal Care and Adequacy of Received Visits. Each component is reported on a four-point scale. The Adequacy of Initiation of Prenatal Care scale relates to the month prenatal care was initiated (Adequate-Plus = months 1–2, Adequate = months 3–4, Intermediate = months 5–6 and Inadequate = months 7–9 or no care at all); the Adequacy of Received Visits scale is based on the percent of visits received of those expected in an uncomplicated pregnancy adjusted for gestational age of birth (Adequate-Plus = 110% or more; Adequate = 80–109%, Intermediate = 50–79%; Inadequate = 0–49%). Relative risks were assessed for all four categories for each scale and for a three-category model, collapsing Inadequate and Intermediate levels into one category.   2.3. Statistical Analysis   Chi-square analyses were used to report bivariate associations for maternal and infant characteristics. Relative risk analyses were conducted to compare risks for children born large and appropriate weight for gestational age for three outcomes: not meeting proficiency on the third grade standards-based mathematics assessment, not meeting proficiency on the third grade standards-based English language arts assessment and referred for special education at any time. Then, effect modification by maternal obesity, pregestational diabetes and gestational diabetes was assessed using an interaction term approach [20], analyzing interaction as well as relative risks in the presence and absence of these potential modifiers. Analyses included modeling unadjusted, partially adjusted and fully adjusted relative risk models using the GENMOD procedure with a binomial distribution. For all risk analyses, a modified Poisson was employed when binomial models did not converge [21,22]. Sensitivity analyses assessed fully adjusted risk models controlling for preterm birth.  When obesity, pregestational diabetes or gestational diabetes modified the effect of LGA, chi-square analyses were used to characterize maternal, neonatal and prenatal care differences between children born large and appropriate weight for gestational age, among children of women with the effect modifying condition. For these analyses, children with missing or incomplete data for the prenatal care variables were removed. Relative risks were calculated for maternal prenatal care utilization for children born LGA within the effect modifying group. SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses. 2.4. Ethical Statement The Longitudinal Study of Early Development (IRB No. 08-046) was approved by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in June 2008 (approval letter dated 11 July 2008 and initial approval period expiring 22 June 2009). The Longitudinal Study of Early Development (LSED) dataset was created by linking administrative records, compiling analytic files and then removing and permanently destroying all personally identifying information. Because the dataset was deidentified, no consent was required. 3. Results   Table 1 reports characteristics of the study cohort. Being born LGA evidenced a small but significant protective effect on not meeting proficiency on the standards-based assessments (unadjusted LGA vs. AGA: mathematics—23.4% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.02; English language arts—39.9% vs. 41.3%, p = 0.01). In fully adjusted relative risk models, compared to children born appropriate weight for gestational age, children born LGA had a lower risk of not meeting proficiency on the mathematics (ARR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92–0.99)) and English language arts (ARR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95–0.99)) assessments but this risk approached nonsignificance (Table 2).  Note: AGA, appropriate weight for gestational age (10–90th percentile); LGA, large for gestational age (>90th percentile). a Based on Oken curve (BMC Pediatr. 2003). b Maternal behaviors during pregnancy. c Gestational weight gain was considered excessive if women weighing less than 200 lbs gained more than 40 lb or if women weighing 200 lb or more gained more than 25 lb. These weight gain cut-points represent the most weight a woman falling within each dichotomous weight category (underweight/normal/overweight and overweight/obese) are recommended to gain. [23].   3.1. Assessing Effect Modification by Maternal Obesity or Diabetes In this cohort (n = 108,348), 8% of children were born LGA. Being born LGA was more prevalent among children of women with obesity and diabetes: 16% of children born to women who were obese, 19.8% of children born to women with pregestational diabetes and 16.4% of children born to women with gestational diabetes were born LGA.  3.1.1. Obesity  There was no significant effect modification by maternal obesity.  3.1.2. Pregestational Diabetes  Among children born to women with pregestational diabetes, comparing children born LGA or appropriate weight for gestational age, there was no significant difference in percentage meeting proficiency on the mathematics or English language arts assessments (Mathematics LGA vs. AGA: 35.2% vs. 32.4%; p = 0.65; English language arts-LGA vs. AGA: 54.9% vs. 45.6%; p = 0.16). Likewise, no significant increased risk was found for children born LGA to women with pregestational diabetes (Mathematics ARR: 1.08 (0.78–1.50); English language arts ARR: 1.14 (0.92–1.41); special education ARR: 0.94 (0.63–1.38)).  3.1.3. Gestational Diabetes  Comparing risks for children born large versus appropriate weight for gestational age, gestational diabetes significantly modified the effect on each outcome. Among children born to women with gestational diabetes, children born LGA were at increased risk of not meeting proficiency on the mathematics assessment (ARR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.07–1.31)). Conversely, among children of women who did not have gestational diabetes, being born LGA had a protective effect on not meeting proficiency on assessments (mathematics ARR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90–0.97); English language arts ARR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94–0.99)) compared to children born appropriate weight for gestational age. Additionally, children born LGA evidenced an increased risk of being referred for special education if the mother had gestational diabetes (ARR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02–1.37)) but no increased risk if the mother did not have gestational diabetes (ARR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92–1.01)). The results are detailed in Table 3.   3.2. Children of Women with Gestational Diabetes: Characterizing Children Born LGA   Associations between maternal characteristics as well as adverse maternal and neonatal conditions related to gestational diabetes and being born LGA are detailed in Table 4. Among children of women with gestational diabetes, being born LGA was associated with the mother not being married, multiparity, maternal obesity, excessive gestational weight gain and a prior sibling born 4000 g or more. No associations were found between maternal chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia and being born LGA. Being born LGA was not associated with being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Among women with gestational diabetes, no infant born LGA had a metabolic disorder at birth, anemia, a seizure or birth injury and prevalence of intubation was similar for infants born large or appropriate weight for gestational age.  Among children born to women with gestational diabetes, children of women receiving Inadequate levels of expected prenatal care visits were 67% more likely than children of women receiving Adequate-Plus levels of visits to be born LGA (ARR: 1.67 (95% CI: 1.20–2.33)). Furthermore, the summary APNCU Index indicated an increased risk of being born LGA for children of women in the Adequate and Inadequate/Intermediate categories compared to children of women who were in the Adequate-Plus category (Adequate ARR: 1.25 (95% CI: 1.05–1.48); Inadequate/Intermediate ARR: 1.21 (95% CI: 1.02–1.44)). 4. Discussion This study explored the effect of being born LGA on academic delays and potential moderation by maternal diabetes and obesity and characterized the risks for LGA for children of mothers with the mediating condition. We found that children born LGA evidenced similar or significantly better assessment outcomes than children born appropriate weight for gestational age, unless the mother had gestational diabetes. For children of women without gestational diabetes being born LGA was protective for not meeting proficiency on the standards-based assessments, while for children of women with gestational diabetes being born LGA was a risk factor for not meeting proficiency on the mathematics assessment and for being referred for special education.  While LGA is a notable adverse outcome for mother and infant in the perinatal period, our study suggests that being born LGA may be associated with positive long-term outcomes in some pregnancies but may be an indicator for poor long-term learning and neurodevelopmental outcomes in others. The mechanisms driving the differences seen for children born LGA is an important consideration. LGA may be a result of genetic factors or an adverse fetal environment. Explaining the association between gestational diabetes and LGA, the Pederson Hypothesis promotes that hyperglycemia in the mother leads to hyperinsulin in the fetus and accelerated fetal growth [24]. In addition to fetal growth, the fluctuations of insulin and glucose lead to hypoxia-ischemia, hypoglycemia, and iron deficiency, which may adversely affect the developing brain, specifically the hippocampus [25].  In addition to suggesting that delays for children of diabetic women may be associated with alteration in brain development due to the milieu in utero, it has been suggested that long-term delays may also be a function of adverse perinatal events associated with diabetic pregnancies [25,26]. In our study, among women with gestational diabetes, neonatal anemia, metabolic condition of the newborn, infant need for intubation, seizure, birth injury, being born preterm or need for neonatal intensive care unit were not more common among LGA infants as compared to infants born appropriate weight for gestational age. Therefore, in our study, we cannot attribute the increased risk of delays seen for LGA children of women with gestational diabetes to an increased rate of these events.  Children of women with an Inadequate/Intermediate or Adequate score on the summary APNCU Index evidenced an increased risk of being born LGA. In this cohort, scoring Adequate-Plus on the APNCU Index and the Adequacy of Received Visits Index may be indicative of better diabetic care and tighter glycemic control, leading to a more appropriate fetal growth rate. This is supported by studies reporting that an intensification of diabetic care during pregnancy reduces rates of LGA and fetal macrosomia to levels seen in nondiabetic populations [27,28,29].   4.1. Strengths and Limitations Our study assessed a large US-based cohort, assessed children through the third grade on multiple measures and considered effect modification by maternal obesity and diabetes, contributing to the recent literature on long-term risks for children born LGA. As far as we know, our study is the first US-based cohort study to assess long-term academic outcomes and the need for special education for children born LGA with effect modification by maternal obesity and diabetes, maternal conditions at high-risk of an LGA birth.  There is a need for additional studies on long-term neurodevelopmental, learning and academic outcomes of children born LGA. While Paulson et al. reported no significant difference between infants born large and appropriate weight for gestational age at nine months, two years, prekindergarten and kindergarten [9], three other studies, two which focused on results for children born small for gestational age, support our findings that LGA may be protective in some general populations. A study in the Republic of Belarus assessing the association of weight for gestational age and IQ in 6.5-year-old children found a higher mean full-scale and verbal IQ score for children born LGA compared to children born small for gestational age (<10th percentile) and to children at the 10–50th percentile appropriate weight [30]. A cohort study in the United Kingdom assessing risks for specific causes for special education need by gestational age and birth weight percentile found being born at the 91–97th percentile significantly reduced risk of intellectual impairment when compared to children born at the 21–80th percentile reference range (ARR: 0.88 (CI: 0.79–0.98)) [31]. Additionally, a study in Australia found children born LGA at term were more likely to meet reading standards compared to an appropriate weight counterpart [10]. Of note, these prior studies did not assess results stratified by maternal obesity and diabetes. Our study also assessed these effects controlling for preterm birth, yet no differences were found. Our study highlights that, compared to an appropriate weight for gestational age, being born LGA may decrease the risk of academic and learning delays within some populations and increase risk within others, a discrepancy that may be missed when assessing LGA risks without stratification by maternal conditions. With high rates of obesity and diabetes in young women and the association between obesity and diabetes in pregnancy and higher rates of LGA births, this is of particular public health interest as the percent of LGA infants is likely to increase.  We were limited by the data available from birth certificates. As noted, using BMI as the measure to identify maternal obesity would be preferable, but height data were not available to compute BMI. Additionally, although our study controlled for many maternal and birth characteristics, our study was unable to control for socioeconomic status. Although we controlled for maternal Medicaid use and maternal education, which may serve as proxies for this unavailable measure, residual confounding may remain. We were unable to control for other potential confounders such as nutrition status of child or parental status. Further, other factors may influence or mediate risk such as maternal intelligence [32], metabolic syndrome [8] or obesity in childhood [33], physical activity during pregnancy [34,35] and breastfeeding [36]. Again, these data were not available in birth or educational records but would be of interest. Additionally, misclassification or under-reporting of some conditions or complications in birth records may have occurred. While patients with rubella and other sexually transmitted infections were excluded, other infections that are associated with poor neurodevelopment (such as CMV) were not evaluated for in this dataset, and, therefore, were not excluded.  In assessing prenatal care utilization, we found Adequate-Plus levels to be associated with better outcomes on two of the indices, yet some studies using the APNCU Index report a U-shaped association with poor outcomes for women in the Adequate-Plus category [37,38]. As the APNCU Index and the Adequacy of Received Visits Index were created based on the number of visits expected in uncomplicated pregnancies, it may underestimate the adequate number of prenatal care visits for women with medical risks such as diabetes and the Adequate-Plus category may better represent standard or adequate care for women with diabetes [19] and as such, in our cohort, found to be associated with better outcomes within this group.   4.2. Future Directions   Future studies could seek to address additional factors including birth order, maternal weight loss between pregnancies and different levels of BMI which was unavailable for this study [39]. Studies may also explore effects to differential exposures to medications on LGA and neurodevelopmental and general neonatal outcomes.  Follow-up studies may be able to assess the risks for children of women with pregestational diabetes; our study was not powered to conclusively compute these risks. As the prevalence of pregestational diabetes in women of childbearing age will likely increase in future birth cohorts [40,41], assessing the risks for children born LGA of women with pregestational diabetes may be possible and of interest.  Additionally, studies assessing prenatal care strategies for women with gestational diabetes, including nutritional therapy, may look to assess the impact on LGA rates as well as delays in children [42]. Understanding the potential for mitigation of delays is an important next step. Large-scale public health interventions taking a preventative approach, such as lifestyle interventions and other programs addressing overweight and obesity before pregnancy may reduce the rate of gestational diabetes and the resulting delays seen in children born LGA of gestational diabetes [43]. Studies should also explore other discrepant characteristics between children born LGA and AGA (e.g., head-size, microcephaly, hearing or vision loss, history of oxygen use) noting potential mechanisms and areas for intervention.  Lastly, future replication studies should be conducted in other populations beyond public school students in large US cities, as the generalizability of this study is limited by those parameters. Studies based in diverse low- and middle-income countries, as well as replication studies assessing outcomes by country of birth, race/ethnicity and by population density (rural/urban), should be considered [44].  5. Conclusions This study suggests that being born LGA may have a protective effect on some children and a detrimental effect on children born LGA to women with gestational diabetes. Among children of women with gestational diabetes, being born LGA was associated with poorer academic outcomes than being born appropriate weight for gestational age; however, achieving an appropriate number of prenatal care visits and increasing utilization of prenatal care among women with gestational diabetes may reduce the number of children born LGA. While LGA is considered to be a risk of adverse perinatal events, long-term cognitive and neurodevelopmental effects associated with being born LGA to women with various conditions have not been well-studied. The long-term risks reported in this study may support interventions to reduce rates of LGA in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes. Future studies are needed in other cohorts to confirm these findings.

Similar results were found in partially adjusted models that controlled for all covariates with the exception of maternal obesity and diabetes (with a slightly less protective effect). Models also controlling for preterm birth (32–36 weeks versus 37 weeks or more) provided similar results. Maternal chronic hypertension was not controlled for as it was not significant in models and its inclusion did not significantly change results. b The bivariate outcome used for not meeting proficiency on standards-based assessments is based on a common educational indicator which denotes failing based on proficiency scores; scoring a 1 or 2 indicates the child did not meet proficiency levels expected at that grade, while scoring a 3 or 4 indicates meeting expected proficiency and above.

    "content": "ABSTRACT    We used a transcriptomic approach to interrogate the effects of a saline-accommodated fraction from the Macondo 252 well (MC252) oil and Corexit dispersants on lung tissue. Wild-type C57BL/6 male and female mice were exposed on days 0, 7 and 13 by oropharyngeal aspiration to saline accommodated fractions (SAF) of crude oil from the Macondo (MC252) well, Corexit 9500, Corexit 9527, 9500+oil and 9527+oil or a saline solution as the vehicle control. These treatments did not cause overt toxicity, with the exception of the Corexit exposures which caused brief weight loss after the first exposure. On day 14, total RNA was isolated from the left lung for RNA-seq analyses. KEGG-pathway-based differential expression revealed that Corexit 9527 elicited the strongest changes involving the upregulation of 19 KEGG pathways (FDR < 0.10), followed by Corexit 9500 with the upregulation of seven pathways (FDR < 0.10). As an important signature, pathways related to a response to DNA damage (e.g., p53 signaling and mismatch repair) dominate those upregulated by Corexit 9527 and Corexit 9500. In addition, pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, IL-17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathways) were upregulated selectively in oil-treated male mice. Surprisingly, oil + dispersant combinations caused lesser effects than the individual treatments at the transcriptomic level. Overall, these findings support potential genotoxicity, inflammation and cell death due to dispersant or oil exposures. Similar exposures to lung tumor bearing K-RasLA1 mice provided evidence for tumor promotion by oil and Corexit dispersant treatments. Our mouse RNA-seq analyses may be relevant to the pulmonary health hazards of MC252 oil and dispersants experienced in exposed populations.  FULL TEXT    1. Introduction   The Deepwater Horizon oil spill (the BP oil spill) was the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and one of the largest environmental disasters in American history [1,2]. During the period of ~5 months (from the explosion of Deepwater Horizon on 20 April 2010 to 19 September 2010), when the well was formally declared sealed, approximately 210 million US gallons of crude oil spilled [1,2] and 1.84 million US gallons of oil dispersants were applied [3,4]. Approximately 50,000 workers were involved in the cleanup during and after the spill. The formation of aerosols containing oil and dispersants on the sea surface at the site of oil spill [5] could present a public health threat. Consequently, short- and long-term health effects might occur from inhaling oil and dispersant chemicals. Respiratory irritation symptoms have been reported in both cleanup workers [6] and the local women of southern Louisiana following the oil spill [7]. Evidence of genotoxic effects that persisted 5–6 years after the Prestige oil spill incident have been reported [8,9]. Therefore, performing experiments under controlled environmental conditions may increase our understanding of the effects on people years after the exposure.  Corexit 9527 [10] and 9500 [10] were the principal dispersants used on the oil that spilled from the Macondo 252 well (MC252, Deepwater Horizon/BP oil spill). There is some evidence that 2-butoxy ethanol, a principal component of Corexit 9527, may be carcinogenic. In a long-term carcinogenesis study, pulmonary exposures to 2-butoxy ethanol produced sex-specific toxicity and cancers of the adrenal glands, forestomach, and liver after chronic pulmonary exposures at relatively high treatments in mice but not rats [11]. The tumorigenic potential of Corexit 9500 or its components have not been described. Oil from the Macondo 252 (MC252) well is a highly characterized light, sweet crude. Crude oils are generally known for their genotoxicity and carcinogenic effects as they contain a multitude of toxic chemicals [12].  Our previous RNA seq studies [13,14] of exposed human airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells) identified five KEGG pathways upregulated by Corexit 9527, including ribosomal biosynthesis (hsa03008) (p = 1.97 × 10−13), protein-processing (hsa04141) (p = 4.09 × 10−7), Wnt signaling (hsa04310) (p = 6.76 × 10−3), neurotrophin signaling (hsa04722) (p = 7.73 × 10−3) and insulin signaling (hsa04910) (p = 1.16 × 10−2) pathways. The co-upregulation of the above pathways suggest carcinogenic potential for Corexit 9527 [15,16,17]. Here, we extended the previous cell culture studies [13,14] to a murine model. We conducted experiments using the wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice of both sexes treated with saline-accommodated fractions (SAF) of MC252 crude oil (treatment group 1), Corexit 9500 (treatment group 2), Corexit 9527 (treatment group 3), 9500+oil (treatment group 4), 9527+oil (treatment group 5) and saline (as controls) (treatment group 6). The lung samples of the treated mice were used for RNA-seq analysis, qRT-PCR, and histology. To assess whether these treatments had effects on tumorigenesis, we also exposed lung tumor bearing K-rasLA1 mice in a similar manner to the B6 mice. Lung tumorigenesis indices, including pleural surface tumor count, tumor burden and tumor cell numbers, were used to compare the effects between a treatment and control (saline).  The most pronounced effects in our previous [14] and present study were observed for the treatment with the SAF of Corexit 9527, which was highlighted by upregulation of a number of pathways related to DNA damage. Similarly, some of the DNA damage pathways were also upregulated by the Corexit 9500 SAF. Moreover, proinflammatory pathways were upregulated by the crude oil SAF in male mice. Consistent with the above observations at the transcriptomics level, the three treatments also increased promotion of lung tumors in the K-rasLA1 mice. Overall, our findings provide evidence supporting DNA damage, proliferation, inflammation, and tumor promotion of oil-spill chemicals for the pulmonary system.  2. Methods  2.1. Preparation of Saline Accomodated Fraction (SAF)   Louisiana Sweet Crude Oil was kindly provided by The Architecture, Engineering, Consulting, Operations and Management Company (AECOM, Los Angeles, CA, USA). This oil was obtained from the site of the Macondo well during the BP Oil Spill disaster. Many studies on the composition and effects of MC252 oil are reported at the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative’s GRIIDC database (https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org). Commercially available Corexit EC9500A and EC9527 dispersants were kindly provided by a contract between Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals, L.P. (Sugar Land, TX, USA) and Tulane University (New Orleans, USA). The dispersants are liquid solutions ready for use. Corexit 9527 is a commercial grade mixture of propylene glycol (1–5%), 2-butoxy ethanol (30.0–60.0%), and proprietary organic sulfonic acid salts (10–30%) [10]. Corexit 9500 consists of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS, 18.2%), sorbitan and isosorbide containing polyethoxylates (2.8%), monoesters (15.8%), diesters (23.9%), triesters (17.3%) and tetraesters (3.3%) and the remaining18.7% is dipropylene glycol butyl ether (DGBE) and Norpar12 [10], a mixture of paraffins that are 5 to 20 carbons in length.  Saline-accommodated fractions (SAF) of MC252 oil, Corexit 9500, Corexit 9527, 9500+oil, and 9527+oil were made per the protocol in our previous study with the exception that Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) replaced water [13]. Briefly, fractions containing oil were prepared at a 1 part oil to 20 parts HBSS ratio, Corexit solutions were prepared at 1:40 HBSS ratios, and the combinations had 0.5 parts Corexit +1 part oil to 20 parts HBSS. After mixing vigorously for 24 h at 300 rpm, the solutions were allowed to separate and the saline phase (for the oil alone sample) was removed and used for the exposures. The other mixtures did not readily phase separate and were used directly (Figure S1).   2.2. Treatment of Wild-Type C57BL/6 Mice for Transcriptome Analysis   Animal protocols were reviewed by the Tulane University institutional animal care and use committee (Protocol ID 106: Impact of Oil Spill to Human Lung Health—Next Generation Sequence and Mouse Model Based Analyses. Date of approval: 02/26/2018). Wild-type C57BL/6 mice 7 weeks of age were purchased from Charles River and acclimated to the vivarium for 1 week before commencing the experiment. The mice were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions and provided food and water ad libitum. Six treatment groups, i.e., oil, Corexit 9500, Corexit 9527, 9500+oil, 9527+oil, saline (control), were set up, with each group containing 3 male or 3 female mice. After 10-fold dilution in HBSS (0.1 SAF), 50µl of each 0.1 SAF was delivered to mice by oropharyngeal aspiration as previously described [18]. Treatments with 0.1 SAFs were on days 0, 7 and 13, with euthanasia and tissue collection on day 14. Upon harvest, the left lung was placed in 1ml Trizol (Ambion) and homogenized in a bead mill homogenizer at power 5 for 60 s. The homogenate was frozen at −80 °C for processing later. The right lung was fixed by perfusion with formalin for histological analyses as previously described [19].   2.3. Treatment of K-RasLA1 Mice   Heterozygous K-RasLA1 mice in the C57BL/6 background were provided by Dr. Tyler Jacks through the National Cancer Institute Mouse Repository. These mice, which harbor a duplication of exon 1 in a non-functional allele of K-Ras, spontaneously develop multi-focal lung tumors by 6-8 weeks of age due to stochastic homologous recombination [20].  Male (3–4 per treatment group) and female K-rasLA1 8 week old mice (3–4 per treatment group) were treated by oropharyngeal aspiration with 50µL 0.1 SAFs of oil, 9500, 9527, 9500+oil, 9527+oil and saline as described above for wild-type B6 mice on days 0, 7, 14 and euthanized at day 21. The lung tissue was processed as described above and the fixed right lung was characterized for lung tumorigenesis indices, i.e., pleural surface tumor count, lung tumor burden, lung tumor cell count. In total, there were 42 mice, including 4 mice of each sex in both the saline (control) and oil groups, 4 male mice in the 9527 and the 9527+oil groups and 3 mice of each sex in each of the remaining treatment groups. 2.4. RNA-seq of Wild-Type C57BL/6 Mice The Trizol homogenate was thawed to room temperature and 200 µl chloroform was added followed by vortexing. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C in a heavy phase lock gel tube (Five Prime). The upper phase was transferred to a tube containing an equal volume of 70% ethanol. Subsequent RNA purification was with a RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). DNA was removed from the isolated RNA by DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and the RNA was re-purified by RNeasy mini kit. Total RNA was sent to Omega Bioservices (Norcross, GA, USA) for sequencing. At Omega Bioservices (Norcross, GA, USA), before RNA-sequencing, the total RNA for each specimen was checked for quality using Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RNA Integrity Numbers (RINs) for all the specimens as obtained by TapeStation passed a score of 8.0 or greater. Upon quality check, mRNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA sequencing kit. The sequencing depth was at least 40 million reads, with paired end reads of 150 bps (PE150). The raw RNA-seq data were submitted to NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) with accession number of GSE137204. 2.5. Characterization of K-RasLA1 Mice For each K-RasLA1 mouse, the number of pleural surface tumors on fixed lung tissue was counted by three investigators, who were blind to the treatment group assignment. The counts from three investigators were averaged to represent the number of pleural surface tumors for that specimen for downstream statistical analyses. Tissue sections prepared from paraffin-embedded fixed lung tissue were cut at 5µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) before evaluation of tumor burden and tumor cell number. The tumor burden (defined as the ratio of hyperplastic lesion area to total lung section area on H&E-stained sections) was quantified with an Aperio ScanScope slide scanner. Tumor cell number was the total number of cells contained in all the specific tumor areas as determined by the image analysis software (Genie) of the slide scanner. 2.6. RNA-seq Data Analysis   RNA-seq raw data (fastq data) passed for overall quality using FastQC program (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).The transcript quantification analysis of fastq data was performed using Salmon program [21]. Specifically, an index file was first built using the reference transcriptome for mouse (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa). Then, fastq data of each sample were aligned to the index file for transcript quantification using “salmon quant” command, which resulted in a quant.sf file containing count information for each transcript. The resultant files, quant.sf files, for all the samples were then grouped and analyzed together using R and Bioconductor’s tximport package [22], which generated a count matrix, with rows as transcript IDs and columns as specific samples.  The count matrix was then analyzed using DESeq2 package [23] for differential expression analysis, which produced differentially expressed genes between two comparison groups based on a model using the negative binomial distribution. To discover differential expression at the pathway level, another package, GAGE [24], was used to identify those KEGG pathways that are differentially regulated between two conditions. The package is based on a meta-test that summarizes t test statistics (for differential expression at the individual gene level) for all genes contained in a pathway. Differential pathway expression may be identified if a large number of individual genes in the pathway have the same direction of differential expression. An FDR value of <0.10 was used for significance threshold.  We submitted up- and downregulated gene expression data (p < 0.05) to DAVID [25] (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) to obtain functional annotation (e.g., GO terms). A Bonferroni corrected p value < 0.05 was used for significance threshold of gene set enrichment. The above differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment were performed on the total (pooled both sexes) sample and sex-specific samples respectively.   2.7. Real-Time PCR Experiments   RNA purity and concentration were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). First-strand cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR was performed with primer sets shown in Supplemental Table S1 with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. After PCR, a melting curve inferred the specificity of the amplification. Relative expression of a specific target mRNA was normalized against a mouse internal control mRNA, 36B4 (a ribosomal protein).   2.8. Statistical Analysis of Tumor Indices of K-RasLA1 Mice and Real-Time PCR Data An extreme outlier (mouse #17), which is defined as >3 IQR (interquartile range) from the median, was identified for tumor cell number and tumor burden and hence was removed for subsequent analysis.  We used a Poisson regression model (with glm function in R) to analyze the association of pleural surface tumor count with different treatments, while adjusting for sex. We used the lm function in R to analyze the association of log-transformed tumor burden and log-transformed tumor cell count with different treatments, while adjusting for sex. This adjustment of sex aimed to remove the difference in an outcome of interest (e.g., tumor burden) that might be attributed to the sex difference so as to achieve a more precise estimate of the treatment effects. We used a multiple regression analysis approach, as implemented in the lm function in R, to analyze the real-time PCR data, which follows the method by Yuan et al. [26]. As compared with the traditional delta–delta CT method, this method can accommodate covariate information (such as sex in our study) in the real-time PCR experimental design. Specifically, for each mouse subject, the CT values for the reference gene (36B4 gene) and the target gene (e.g., Chek1 gene) were averaged over technical replicates. Then the CT value of the reference gene was deducted from the CT of the target gene to obtain the delta CT value, i.e., the delta CT value was tested for effect of a treatment (e.g., Corexit 9527) while adjusting for sex under regression analysis, where we coded the treatment variable under two levels, e.g., Corexit 9527 and control, with control as the “baseline” level. The fold change of the treatment (Corexit 9527) vs. control (saline) was estimated through regression coefficient for the treatment term, i.e., 2 to the negative power of the regression coefficient. A significant regression coefficient for treatment variable indicates confirmation of real-time PCR results. For example, a significant (p < 0.05) “negative” regression coefficient of treatment, suggesting a lower delta CT value in the treatment, e.g., Corexit 9527, as compared to the control, confirms “upregulation” of a gene in the treatment vs. control.  3. Results  3.1. Pilot Experiments Determined Tolerable Treatments for RNA-seq Experiments   Our initial experiment with three female mice was designed to determine a dose of Corexit 9500+oil SAF that caused lung injury in mice. Previous experiments indicated that the Corexit 9500+oil and Corexit 9527+oil SAF displayed similar toxicity curves with BEAS-2B cells in culture and that at 1/100 dilution of both solutions was toxic [27]. Therefore, mice were treated by oropharyngeal aspiration with 50µL of the 1/100 dilution SAF and 10-fold higher (1/10) and lower dilutions (1/1,000) SAF to assess their tolerability. Mice sacrificed on day 14 tolerated three treatments (day 0, 7 and 13) with each dilution of Corexit 9500+oil. The mouse exposed to the 1/10 dilution of Corexit 9500+oil SAF displayed modest weight loss (<5%) on the initial treatment but recovered and did not exhibit significant weight loss on the two subsequent treatments. Moreover, H&E stained tissue sections of fixed lung tissue from the exposed mice showed modest evidence of lung injury. Subsequent experiments were performed with 1/10 dilution of each SAF.  A second preliminary experiment was performed with six female mice with one mouse treated with saline, oil, Corexit 9500, Corexit 9527, Corexit 9500+oil, Corexit 9527+oil, respectively, on day 0, 7 and 13 @ a concentration of 1/10 SAF before euthanasia on day 14. A third preliminary experiment was performed with male mice that repeated the second preliminary experiment. For each experiment, each treatment regimen was tolerated. The mice treated with 1/10 SAF of Corexit 9500 or Corexit 9527 exhibited weight loss (~10%) on the initial treatment but recovered to gain weight through subsequent treatments. Surprisingly, the addition of oil to the SAF of the dispersant (either Corexit 9500 or Corexit 9527) reduced the severity of weight loss to ~2% on the initial treatment. Microscopic assessment of H&E stained sections of fixed lung tissue revealed areas of minor focal inflammation that were most pronounced in the mouse treated with Corexit 9527.  The gross and histological assessments of female and male mice in the second and third preliminary experiments are presented in Supplemental Figure S3. Additionally presented is the weight change data in second preliminary experiment.   3.2. Total Sample Analyses Identified DNA Damage Effects from Corexit 9527/9500   We observed a stable weight increase in the treated mice over the two weeks with the exception of the Corexit 9527 treatment, which induced a drop of weight on the initial few days in both male and female mice (Figure 1). However, even mice of that treatment group later gained weight through subsequent treatments and returned to normal within one week (Figure 1).  Thirty-six wild-type B6 male and female mice (3 of each sex per treatment) were exposed by oropharyngeal aspiration to saline (control) or 1/10 SAF of oil and/or dispersant as described above on days 0, 7 and 13 before euthanasia on day 14. The left lung of each mouse was processed for total RNA sequencing and the right lung was processed for histology. Total RNA yield per mouse varied according to sex and treatment (Figure S2). As observed in the preliminary experiments, microscopic examination of tissue sections from the treated mice revealed areas of focal inflammation that were most prevalent in mice treated with either 1/10 SAF of Corexit 9500 or Corexit 9527. Through GAGE analysis [24] of total lung RNA prepared from the exposed mice, we identified three treatments, Corexit 9527, Corexit 9500 and 9527+oil, that induced significant differential expression at the KEGG pathway level (FDR < 0.10) (Table 1). The strongest effects were observed for Corexit 9527, as the treatment induced a large number of KEGG pathways, with 19 upregulated (Table 1, group 1) and four downregulated (Table 1, group 2). For the other two treatments, Corexit 9500 caused seven pathways upregulated (Table 1, group 3) and 9527+oil led to two pathways downregulated (Table 1, group 4).  Of note on the pathways upregulated by Corexit 9527, ~10 were related to responses to DNA damage (Table 1, group 1), as exemplified by p53 signaling, Fanconi anemia and mismatch repair. Most of the pathways related to DNA damage were also upregulated by Corexit 9500 (Table 1, group 3). Shown in Figure 2 are KEGG pathway plots for some example pathways related to DNA damage response, which were upregulated by Corexit 9527, including p53 signaling, mismatch repair, homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways. The KEGG pathway plots were generated with the R package PathView [28]. As shown in the pathway plots, red colors are pervasive, suggesting an overall “turned-on”, i.e., upregulation, of the genes in the pathways.  To confirm the above results for upregulated pathways by Corexit 9527 related to DNA damage and repair, we submitted the upregulated genes (p < 0.05) to the online gene set enrichment analysis portal DAVID [25]. For Corexit 9527 treatment, several functional terms such as DNA damage, DNA repair, and cellular response to DNA damage stimulus all achieved significant enrichment in both male and female mice (Table 2).  We selected 11 of the most prominently activated genes related to DNA damage response and DNA repair for real-time PCR confirmation among mice treated with Corexit 9527 as compared to saline (as controls) (Table 3). All of the expressed genes from Corexit 9527 treated mice were confirmed using regression analysis of delta CT values (adjusting for sex effect) with significant p values (p < 0.05). Table 3 also shows the major functions of each listed gene related to DNA damage and repair.   3.3. Sex-Specific Analyses Identified Stronger Effects in Male Mice and Proinflammatory Pathways Upregulated by Oil in Male Mice   Differential expression analyses for each treatment was also performed in male and female mice, respectively. In general, treatment effects were stronger in male than female mice as more pathways were significantly altered relative to the saline control (FDR < 0.10) in male than female mice (Table 4, groups 1, 3, 4, 6 vs. groups 2, 5, 7, 8). For Corexit 9527, the major signatures were related to DNA damage responses, which were observed to be upregulated in both male and female mice, although the signals were stronger with more pathways upregulated in male than in female mice (Table 4, groups 1 and 2). Treatment with the MC252 crude oil SAF showed significant effects on male mice. Upregulation of proinflammatory pathways, such as cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, IL-17 signaling, chemokine signaling and TNF signaling pathways were predominant (Table 4, group 4). As examples, Figure 3 shows two KEGG proinflammatory pathways, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and IL-17 signaling, which are upregulated by oil in male mice. The above upregulated pathways were not detected in the female mice treated with 1/10 oil SAF. As an exception, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway was observed downregulated in female mice treated with oil (Table 4, group 5).  Three pathways related to DNA damage response, cell cycle, DNA replication and homologous recombination were also upregulated in Corexit 9500-treated male mice (Table 4, group 6). Treatment of 9527+oil in female mice activated pathways related to tissue regeneration, such as Hippo, Notch, MAPK and Wnt signaling (Table 4, group 7).  To confirm the upregulated pathways related to DNA damage and repair by Corexit 9527 and the proinflammatory pathways upregulated by oil SAF treatment in male mice, we submitted to DAVID [25] the upregulated genes. Terms significantly enriched in the submitted genes from exposed male mice included innate immune response, chemokine-mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of inflammatory response and cytokines (Table 2).  To confirm if there was downregulation of proinflammatory activities in female mice treated with oil SAF, the DAVID analysis of genes downregulated in female mice was performed and did not detect significant enrichment of any term related to inflammation, immune response and cytokine activities, etc.  The number of differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05) in pooled and sex-specific samples are shown in Supplemental Table S2.   3.4. Tumor-Bearing K-RasLA1 Mice Showed Accelerated Tumorigenesis Induced by Oil and Dispersants   Eight week old tumor-bearing K-RasLA1 (C57BL/6 background) mice were treated by oropharyngeal aspiration with 1/10 SAFs of oil and/or dispersants on days 0, 7 and 14 followed by sacrifice on day 21. For control purposes, K-RasLA1 mice were treated with an equal volume of HBSS. The right lung of each mouse was fixed for analyses of lung tumor growth. Supplemental Figure S4 shows the box plots for the K-RasLA1 mice tumor indices (pleural surface tumor count, tumor cell number and tumor burden). Supplemental Figure S5 shows an example of tumor nodules on the pleural surface of a K-RasLA-1 mice.  Comparison of tumor indices between a treatment group with control (Figure 4) suggested an increased pleural surface tumor count, tumor burden and tumor cell number in oil or Corexit 9527 treatments. Such an increase is more pronounced in the male group.  Based on regression analyses of association of each tumor index with different treatments, while adjusting for sex, oil treatment achieved a significant increase of pleural surface tumor count (p = 0.036), tumor burden (p = 0.030) and tumor cell number (p = 0.020) as compared with the control. Corexit 9527 caused significant increases of pleural surface tumor count (p = 0.026), and tumor cell number (p = 0.042) and a marginally significant increase of tumor burden (p = 0.073) as compared with the control. Corexit 9500 achieved a marginally significant increase of tumor burden (p = 0.087) and tumor cell number (p = 0.089) as compared with control. In addition, 9527+oil achieved a marginally significant increase of tumor cell number (p = 0.092) as compared with control.  Supplemental Figure S6 shows example images (one example subject from each treatment) of tumor burden characterization of K-RasLA-1 mice under different treatments.   3.5. Upregulation of Cell Division/Cell Cycle Activities Promoted by Corexit 9527 is the Shared Signals with Previous RNA-seq Studies on Airway Epithelial Cells (the BEAS-2B Cell Line)   We compared the results of the current study (Table 1) with previous RNA-seq studies [13,14] on airway epithelial cells (the BEAS-2B cell line). The comparisons were performed at the KEGG pathway level and at the individual gene level and the similarities are shown in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. At the pathway level, the consensus between the current study and the previous study [14] was achieved only for the Corexit 9527 treatment, where seven KEGG pathways were observed upregulated in both mouse lungs and BEAS-2B cells at a significance level of FDR < 0.10 (Table 5). The cell cycle pathway achieves the most significant meta-analysis p value (p= 4.22 × 10−20), suggesting the highest overall significance when combining the findings from two studies on the shared pathways. At the individual gene level, again, Corexit 9527 has the highest number of regulated genes (29 upregulated and 10 downregulated genes) shared between the current study and the previous study [13] (Table 6). Using DAVID enrichment analysis to annotate the 29 shared upregulated genes due to Corexit 9527 treatment (by submitting the 29 ENSG IDs), several significant functional terms, including Cell Division (FDR = 3.51 × 10−8), Mitosis (FDR = 1.22 × 10−6) and Cell Cycle (FDR = 5.25 × 10−6), were identified. In summary, the major common signal detected in both human airway epithelial cells [13,14] and mouse lung tissue is the upregulation of cell division and cell cycle activities promoted by Corexit 9527.  4. Discussion   This study builds upon previous reports [13,14] showing responses of human airway epithelial cells treated with fractions of oil and/or dispersant chemicals. In particular, Corexit 9527 treatment produced upregulated KEGG pathways related to carcinogenesis [14]. However, these findings were achieved through an in vitro system and hence their applicability to exposed humans needed to be investigated with an animal model.  Overall, the major signals detected in this study include upregulation of DNA damage/repair activities by Corexit 9527 treatment and enhanced proinflammatory activities by oil SAF treatment. Our results related to DNA damage due to Corexit 9527 and 9500 provide evidence to support the chemicals’ lung tumor promoting effects. DNA damage is a major mechanism underlying development of human cancers as damaged DNA may be replicated before repair, which gives rise to somatic mutations and altered proteins, resulting in cancer promotion [40]. Notably, in our study, in addition to DNA damage-related pathways, cell cycle and DNA replication pathways were also upregulated by Corexit 9527 and 9500 (Table 1 and Table 2). The increased cell cycle and DNA replication activities, a mechanism to replace damaged cells, may further replicate the somatic mutations generated from DNA damage initiated by dispersants, which may further enhance tumorigenesis.  Our results regarding proinflammatory signals in male mice due to oil SAF treatment also suggest contributions to lung carcinogenesis. An inflammatory microenvironment is one of the “hallmarks of cancer” [41]. Epidemiological evidence supports an important role of inflammation in lung cancer development [42]. A recent study comparing 807 incident lung cancer cases and 807 smoking-matched controls from three prospective cohorts identified a higher lung cancer risk for those participants with elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting an important role of inflammation in lung cancer etiology [43]. A similar association with prospective risk of lung cancer was achieved for other inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 [44]. Moreover, we and others showed previously that interleukin-17 promotes lung tumor growth in murine models [45,46,47].  Using lung tumor bearing K-RasLA1 mice, we tested the effects on tumorigenesis using the same treatments as in our RNA-seq studies. Interestingly, lung tumorigenesis indices of K-RasLA1 mice were generally consistent with RNA-seq results of wild-type B6 mice in terms of signal intensities of significant pathways, such as those related to DNA damage, cell division and proinflammatory activities. The treatments that promoted lung tumorigenesis in K-RasLA1 mice are oil and Corexit 9527, as might have been predicted from the RNA-seq results of B6 mice. Both of these two treatments led to significantly increased (p < 0.05) pleural surface tumors and tumor cell number in the lung. The two treatments also caused significant (p < 0.05), or marginally significant (p < 0.10), increases in tumor burden. In addition, Corexit 9500 treatment marginally increased (p < 0.10) both tumor burden and tumor cell number. This is also consistent with the intensity of signals of Corexit 9500 in the RNA-seq results.  Sex specificity is also observed in K-RasLA1 mice, as in the wild-type B6 mice. As shown in Figure 4 (right panels), for the 1/10 SAF treatments of oil and Corexit 9527, the increase of tumorigenesis measures as compared to control (saline) were stronger in males than in females. This result is in agreement with the stronger signals in male than female mice for the RNA-seq results (Table 4). Overall, our K-RasLA1 data provided consistent support for the expectations based on our RNA-seq data, where we predict that Corexit 9527 and oil treatments promote tumorigenesis due to the DNA damage and proinflammatory effects, respectively.  Similar to the sex-specific findings from our study, a recent study on the acute neurological effects of oil-spill cleanup-related exposures based on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Coast Guard Cohort also reported sex-related neurological symptoms that were stronger in males than females [48]. We speculate that the sex difference in response to oil spill chemicals may be largely immune mediated as sex-specific differences in the immune response are well documented in the literature [49]. For example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from human males produce more TNF than PBMCs from females following lipopolysaccharide stimulation [50,51]. However, the sex difference in response to oil spill chemicals at the levels of gene expression and tumorigenesis in our study still needs to be further validated. For example, further testing in castrated or ovariectomized animals could implicate hormonal effects in the sex selective responses.  Toxicities of dispersants Corexit 9500 and 9527, which include predator/prey recognition, enzyme activity changes, effects on egg hatchability, and the threshold for bradycardia have been documented for animals [4]. Respiratory irritation symptoms associated with exposure to Corexit 9500 and 9527 have been reported in a portion of ~30,000 participants involved in Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill cleanup [6]. Similar symptoms, such as burning in the nose, throat and lungs, were also identified in women of southern Louisiana after the oil spill [7]. However, the long-term impacts of Corexit 9527 and 9500 and crude oil on the human respiratory system remain undetermined. Our previous RNA-seq-based studies with human airway epithelial cells [13,14] and the present study address public health concerns of Corexit 9500 and 9527 related to lung health.  The main difference in chemical components between the two types of Corexit is 2-butoxy ethanol, which is a major component of Corexit 9527 but not included in Corexit 9500 [4]. The presence of 2-butoxy ethanol may account for the higher toxicity of Corexit 9527 relative to Corexit 9500, as suggested in our RNA-seq data. However, the comparison of lethality and toxicity of the two kinds of Corexit is still inconclusive. As reviewed in [4], Corexit 9527 may be more lethal and toxic than Corexit 9500 to invertebrates but vice versa for fish. No comparison of the relative toxicities of the two dispersants has been tested for birds and mammals yet [4].  The overlap between the current study and our previous RNA-seq study on human airway epithelial cells [13,14] is limited (Table 5). This may have been expected beforehand due to the limitations of a single cell culture compared with lung tissue of greater cellular complexity. Indeed, the limitations of the previous studies [13,14] are the reasons we initiated the current study. Despite the differences, comparison of the current study with the previous ones [13,14] does provide some interesting results; the overlap is mainly observed for the effects of Corexit 9527. The main signal of Corexit 9527 treatment in both an airway epithelial cell line and lung tissue is the upregulation of cell cycle activities (as shown in both pathway level analysis and in enrichment analysis of overlapping genes), which once again provides support for the tumor promoting potential of Corexit 9527. In that regard, an increase of cell cycle activities is a common observation in carcinogenesis and cell cycle proteins are promising targets in cancer therapy [52].  5. Conclusions Our study, for the first time, identified potential carcinogenic effects of Corexit 9527/9500 and crude oil to the lung system at the mouse gene expression level. Using a mutant K-ras-expressing mouse model, we also demonstrated for the first time accelerated tumorigenesis associated with exposure to crude oil or Corexit 9527/9500. Taken together, we obtained evidence supporting the potential respiratory harm of chronic exposure to oil and dispersants for the general population, especially people working in the oil industry. The next phase of the study may involve genotoxic and immunologic analyses, such as identification of lung somatic mutations that may arise after long-term exposure and characterization of lung immune cells of exposed mice.

Remote learning also will begin during this time.    APS May Move to Yellow After Labor Day     After Labor Day, some students are slated to begin going to school Tuesdays-Fridays on an every-other-week rotation, starting with elementary school students. This is subject to change depending on the spread of the coronavirus and public health orders.     Students who aren't attending classes will take part in online and distance learning on all other days, including Mondays.   Expectations During Yellow   Students will be expected to:     Bring their own mask on in-person instruction days  Wear their mask on the bus and during the school day (with minimal exceptions for students with documented medical conditions).  Students without a mask will be provided one, or parents will be asked to bring one to the school before the student can attend class  Maintain appropriate social distance from others  Frequently wash their hands  or use hand sanitizer (upon arrival, before and after lunch, before and after recess, and at the end of the day)  Bring their school-issued computer device to school every day  Use their computer devices appropriately  Participate in their classes when learning from home  Stay home if they have a temperature of more than 100.4 or any other COVID symptoms   Bring a refillable water bottle as drinking fountains will be off-limits  Not share toys, books, equipment, or supplies",

After years of economic expansion, unemployment reached 11.1 percent in June… Together these programs already insure nearly 40 percent of all children, and they will require both short-term buttressing and long-term solutions so that they can sustain coverage for a growing proportion of children and adolescents. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act provides a number of measures that will temporarily shore-up state Medicaid and CHIP programs for children and parents who have lost their ESI or are otherwise newly income eligible.    …    Read more  here",

The news around COVID-19 has not been encouraging of late. Positive cases are once again surging around the country. In Los Angeles, government and public health officials are considering resuming safer-at-home orders to prevent the spread of the disease. Many of us have been largely stuck at home since March, while others have been risking their lives every day doing that essential work that keeps us healthy and fed and the economy, such as it is, going. With how indefinitely it appears this will continue, it’s easy to get discouraged.    To counter that, we share this video essay from Teo Ruiz, professor emeritus of history, who asserts that “beauty saves,” and asks how we each can add beauty to the world.",

    "title": "Overview of the DOL’s New Fiduciary Rules for Retirement Plan Investment Advice",
    "content": "August 5, 2020 Overview of the DOL’s New Fiduciary Rules for Retirement Plan Investment Advice Peter Daines, Lauren Jackson, Sterling Perkinson, Tom Steed Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: On June 29, 2020, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) announced its new approach to the standards for financial institutions and investment professionals who provide investment advice on a nondiscretionary basis to 401(k) plans, pension plans, or other plans covered by ERISA or to IRAs (collectively, “Retirement Plans”) after its prior 2016 regulations (the “2016 Fiduciary Rule”) were struck down by the Fifth Circuit in June 2018. (See our article: here). The DOL released final regulations that reinstate its definition of who is a fiduciary by reason of providing investment advice to Retirement Plans, which reflect a “5-Part Test” (described below) that had been in effect from 1975 until its modification by the 2016 Fiduciary Rule. The final regulation adds several new interpretations and clarifications to the longstanding 5-Part Test. The DOL also proposed a new prohibited transaction exemption (“PTE”) that, if finalized as proposed, will provide rules for financial institutions and investment professionals seeking to (a) receive compensation from a recommended transaction involving a Retirement Plan, including commissions or additional advisory fees received as the result of advice to an individual to roll funds from a Retirement Plan covered by ERISA to an IRA, and/or (b) conduct principal trades with Retirement Plans to which they provide investment advice. The DOL’s new approach, as discussed herein, has no impact on existing standards for financial institutions or investment professionals with discretionary authority over Retirement Plans. Investment professionals who have discretion to manage Retirement Plan accounts (including IRAs) (or otherwise control such accounts) are fiduciaries and as such there is no need to apply the 5-Part Test to determine whether or not they should be deemed fiduciaries. Background Prohibited Transactions. Both ERISA plans and IRAs are subject to “prohibited transaction” rules under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), which parallel the prohibited transaction rules under ERISA. Collectively, these rules prohibit most transactions between a Retirement Plan and parties with certain relationships to the Retirement Plan, including a “fiduciary” of the Retirement Plan, unless an exemption applies. For example, a fiduciary to a Retirement Plan is prohibited from receiving additional compensation (such as transaction-based compensation or additional advisory fees) from a Retirement Plan due to a transaction by the Retirement Plan that results from the fiduciary’s exercise of authority, control, or responsibility. This prohibition includes a transaction that is the product of investment advice by a fiduciary. Similarly, a fiduciary is prohibited from engaging in a “principal transaction” by buying or selling securities from or to the Retirement Plan’s account. Exemptions to Prohibited Transactions. There are a number of exemptions to the prohibited transaction rules, by statute or issued by the DOL, that provide conditions under which a Retirement Plan may engage in an otherwise prohibited transaction without violating the prohibited transaction rules. These conditions are generally intended to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest that may result from the prohibited transactions. The conditions imposed under PTEs issued by the DOL are an important part of the DOL’s regulation of the management of Retirement Plans. For example, one of the primary criticisms of the 2016 Fiduciary Rule was that the DOL overstepped its authority by applying a condition under the Best Interest Contract Exemption (a PTE issued in connection with the 2016 Fiduciary Rule) that financial institutions must enter into a contract with IRAs that imposes fiduciary standards similar to the fiduciary standards that apply to Retirement Plans subject to ERISA. The requirement to enter into a contract could have given IRA owners or beneficiaries a private right of action that they would not otherwise have had under state or federal law. The 5-Part Test of an Investment Advice Fiduciary The definition of a “fiduciary” under ERISA and the Code, includes those who (1) have discretionary authority over investments or administration of a Retirement Plan or (2) provide investment advice with respect to a Retirement Plan’s assets for a fee or other compensation, whether directly or indirectly. Historically, whether the provision of investment advice meets the definition of a fiduciary is determined through the application of a 5-Part Test. The 5-Part Test was in place from 1975 until it was modified by the Fiduciary Rule in 2016, and then again presumably (following the Fifth Circuit’s vacating of the 2016 Fiduciary Rule) from 2018 to present. The final rule affirms that the 5-Part Test remains effective going forward. The 5-Part Test provides that if a person (who is not otherwise a Retirement Plan fiduciary by reason of discretionary management or control) provides investment advice for a fee with respect to Retirement Plan, that person is considered a fiduciary (an “Investment Advice Fiduciary”) only if that advice is: relating to the value of securities or other property or is a recommendations concerning the advisability of investments (whether in securities, real property, insurance products—including annuities, or other property); provided on a regular basis; pursuant to a mutual understanding or agreement; a primary basis for investment decision-making; and, tailored to the needs of the Retirement Plan. The DOL’s New Interpretation, Clarification of its Application of the 5-Part Test While the DOL’s new regulation, formally reinstating the 5-Part Test, is a retreat from the expansive approach taken in its 2016 Fiduciary Rule, the DOL has now clarified the application of the 5-Part Test in several respects that may result in more financial institutions and financial professionals being deemed a Retirement Plan fiduciary than under the pre-2016 regime. In announcing its new approach, the DOL emphasized its concern regarding the conflicts of interest that may arise from a recommendation to roll over assets from a 401(k) plan or other ERISA plan to an IRA insofar as the rollover results in an investor’s retirement savings losing the protections of ERISA’s fiduciary standards (including DOL oversight and a private right of action for fiduciary breach under ERISA). Because rollover advice is provided with respect to assets of an ERISA plan, the DOL has taken the position that the fiduciary standards of ERISA may apply in addition to the prohibited transaction rules. In sum, a rollover recommendation may now constitute fiduciary investment advice under the 5-Part Test. This contradicts a 2005 DOL advisory opinion (known as the “Deseret Letter”) that generally provided that a party with no prior relationship to an ERISA plan would not become a fiduciary to that plan solely because of a recommendation to roll over the participant’s account balance into another ERISA plan or an IRA. In issuing the final regulations on June 29, the DOL has repudiated the Deseret Letter. The DOL has further clarified the 5-Part Test in some important ways: Advice at the Start of a Relationship. The DOL explained that the “on a regular basis” element of the 5-Part Test can be established when there is a reasonable expectation by the parties that advice will be provided on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, investment advice may be deemed fiduciary in nature even if there was no prior relationship before the advice at issue was provided. Disclaimers of Reliance. A disclaimer that a Retirement Plan cannot rely on the advice given as a primary basis of investment decision-making is not dispositive. The DOL requires a mutual understanding or agreement that advice will not be a primary basis of investment decision-making by the Retirement Plan. As such, disclaimers may still be considered as part of the analysis, but the determination of fiduciary status depends on the reasonable understanding of the parties based on all of the facts and circumstances. Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”). Per the DOL, any investment advice subject to the SEC’s Reg BI standard (which applies to broker-dealers and their registered representatives) or another similar best interest standard (e.g., state best interest or fiduciary rules, such as those of Nevada, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, or Iowa’s proposed best interest standard for insurance sales) would reasonably be understood by the parties as intended to serve as a primary basis of decision-making. Proposed PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries On June 29, the DOL also proposed a related new PTE that would allow Investment Advice Fiduciaries (as defined by application of the 5-Part Test) to receive additional compensation with respect to advice provided to Retirement Plans and/or to engage in riskless principal transactions with Retirement Plans to which they provide fiduciary investment advice. As proposed, the PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries will be available to financial institutions including registered investment advisers, banks, insurance companies, or registered broker-dealers, as well as the investment professionals who work for these institutions. The proposed PTE would not apply to: 1) an employer or certain named fiduciaries, plan administrators, and related parties with respect to an ERISA plan, 2) certain transactions resulting from “robo-advice” arrangements that do not involve interaction with an investment professional, or 3) transactions in which the investment professional is acting in a fiduciary capacity other than by virtue of providing fiduciary investment advice (as defined by the 5-Part Test) (e.g., an investment professional acting with discretion). In order to rely on the proposed PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries, the financial institution and/or investment professional must satisfy and comply with the following requirements: Impartial Conduct Standards. The Impartial Conduct Standards require that the investment advice that leads to the transaction for which the exemption is sought is in the “best interest” of the investor. (“Best interest” is based on the ERISA fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty and will be interpreted and applied consistent with Reg BI.) The financial institution and/or investment professional must receive no more than reasonable compensation for their services, must seek to obtain “best execution” (as required by securities laws), and must not make any materially misleading statement or omission. Disclosure Requirements. Prior to effecting the recommended transaction, the financial institution must provide the Retirement Plan with (1) a written acknowledgement of the fiduciary status of the financial institution and the investment professional with respect to the transaction, and (2) a written description of the services provided and an accurate (not misleading) description of all material conflicts of interest. The DOL stated that these statements should not create a private right of action between the financial institution or investment professional and the Retirement Plan investor. Accordingly, these written disclosures should not be deemed a contract reflecting the creation of a fiduciary relationship between the Retirement Plan and the financial institution and/or investment professional. Policies and Procedures. The financial institution’s policies and procedures must be prudently designed to avoid violations of the Impartial Conduct Standards, including: (1) the avoidance of incentive practices that create a conflict of interest (e.g., sales contests), and (2) the documentation of the specific reasons why a recommendation was made to roll over assets from a 401(k) or other ERISA-covered plan to an IRA. Retrospective Review. The financial institution that relies (or expects to rely) on the PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries must conduct a review at least annually to affirm its compliance with the Impartial Conduct Standards. This annual review must include a certification by the CEO or equivalent officer that he or she has determined that the financial institution’s policies and procedures are prudently designed to avoid violations of the Impartial Conduct Standards and that there is a prudent process in place to modify such policies and procedures as appropriate for business, regulatory, or legislative changes. The financial institution must maintain documentation showing its compliance each of the conditions of the PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries for a six-year period. Documentation should be maintained in the financial institution’s books and records so that is available for review upon demand by the DOL or a Retirement Plan investor. However, the financial institution is not required to provide information to a Retirement Plan investor that would identify or provide information regarding other client accounts (including investment recommendations), or trade secrets, privileged information, or financial information of the financial institution. The comment period of the proposed PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries ends on August 6. It is uncertain whether or when the DOL will issue a final PTE. However, given the recent activity by the SEC, FINRA, certain states, and professional designation organizations, it seems likely that the DOL will move quickly to implement a final regulation. In the meantime, there are a number of existing PTEs that address specific arrangements that financial institutions may be able to rely on until the PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries is finalized (or as an alternative to the PTE for Investment Advice Fiduciaries once it is finalized). For example, there is an existing PTE that allows those providing nondiscretionary advice to a Retirement Plan (including an IRA) to receive a commission for the purchase of an annuity (fixed or variable) by the Retirement Plan—so long as the requirements of the PTE are met.
